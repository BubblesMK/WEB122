                    <h2>The Importance of User Experience</h2>

                    <h3>What is User Experience?</h3>
                    <p>Well, let us look to our good ole friend Google. Google describes User Experience (UX) as “the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.” In other words, how we as users interact and react to these products is user experience. However, as developers and designers our goal is to ensure the user has the best experience in their life…yes, their life! With that said, that leads to another question.</p>

                    <h3>Take Away</h3>
                    <p>When designing a website, you not only want to take care of the needs of your users, but you want to ensure they can navigate your product in a way that is beneficial for them. Remember, they are visiting your website for a purpose. With that said, you may be thinking, how can I know the needs of each of my users? How can I please everyone that views or uses my product? Unfortunately, you will not know everything but you sure can get close. Let us dive in further to see how we can produce valuable, stylish, useful websites and computer applications.</p>

                    <h2>UX Principles We Value</h2>

                    <h3>User-Centered (Centricity)</h3>
                    <p>Focus on the needs and goals of the user FIRST when creating your product. Research and test your product to figure out what it is that your user(s) is looking for and how it will help them.</p>

                    <h3>Usability</h3>
                    <p>How easy is your product to use? Can a user easily navigate your site swiftly and find what they need? Did the user have a positive experience while visiting your website? These are all questions that you as the developer can ask during testing to see if your website is easy to use. Below are five components of usability that you can consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learnability</li>
                        <li>Efficiency</li>
                        <li>Memorability</li>
                        <li>Errors</li>
                        <li>Satisfaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Offer a way to ensure everyone with a variety of circumstances can use and access your website. For example, consider screen readers, keyboard navigation, and including sharp contrast colors to help those who are visual impaired.</p>

                        <a class="icons" href="#"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a>
                        <a class="icons" href="#"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a>
                        <a class="icons" href="#"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>
                    </aside>

                    <!--second half of the article-->
                    <h3>Consistency</h3>
                    <p>This principle is quite simple and straightforward and that is to stay consistent. For example, if the style of your website is business or playful, stick with one and do not alternate. Stay consistent with the design, when you switch up your design it can cause confusion which will lead to the user leaving your site.</p>

                    <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
                    <p>How will the user navigate your website is the question that we as developers must ask ourselves? That is where the hierarchy comes in. You want to make sure the user can view and access the most valuable information first. For example, if your website is for someone who needs to book a party at a recreation center, you would not want your first navigation link to be for events taken place at the center. You would want the first navigation to link to be for booking a room and/or information about the pricing.</p>

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>Consider how and where the user will view your website. Will they view it on a tablet, mobile device, or desktop? Due to the varied sizes of devices, your site will look different. In other words, try to understand where the user will use your website.</p>

                    <div class="contentimg2"></div> <!--image 2-->

                    <h3>User Control</h3>
                    <p>Give a way for the user to have just enough control over their experience with your site. For example, if you have a call to action (CTA) give the user the flexibility to decline the CTA or if they want to revisit the CTA give them the option.</p>

        <p>UX Principles taken from the article <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/ux-design-principles-2026/">7 fundamental user experience (UX) design principles all designers should know in 2026</a></p>
        <p>This fictional website was built as part of a web development course. The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate an understanding of how CSS rules work with normal document flow and box model. Also, we learned how to center content on a webpage using properties such as max-width and margins.</p>
