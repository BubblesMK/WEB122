Assignment Objective:
Create a simple mobile‑first webpage that demonstrates Chapter 1 CSS concepts, including semantic HTML structure, selector usage, and how the cascade resolves conflicting rules.

Requirements:

•  Use external CSS in a /css folder
•  Follow required folder structure (css, js, assets, HTML at root)
•  Include <meta name="author"> in the <head>
•  Use semantic HTML: header, nav, main, footer, section, article, aside
•  Use headings (h1–h6) to outline content
•  Use class selectors (comment at least one)
•  Use one ID selector (explain in footer why IDs should be avoided)
•  Include one CSS shorthand example
•  Include one @supports (display: grid) rule
•  Demonstrate a conflicting CSS rule and explain how the cascade resolves it
•  Include one !important example and explain why it should be avoided
•  Optional: use initial, inherit, unset, or revert
•  Add 2–3 images (public domain) and cite sources in the footer
